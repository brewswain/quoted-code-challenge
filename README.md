## Getting Started

Firstly, the app is available for preview both on [Vercel](https://quoted-code-challenge-d4dx-hbylt7g9e-brewswain.vercel.app/) and [Netlify](https://frolicking-mousse-0cdc97.netlify.app/).

However, if you wish to use this app locally, let's get you started correctly!

First, open up your terminal of choice, and use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/brewswain/quoted-code-challenge.git

cd quoted-code-challenge

npm install

npm run dev
```
Once you've executed all the above, open your browser, and go to `localhost:3000`

That's it!
