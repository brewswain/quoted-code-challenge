## Getting Started

Firstly, the app is available for preview both on [Vercel](https://quoted-code-challenge-d4dx-hbylt7g9e-brewswain.vercel.app/) and [Netlify](https://frolicking-mousse-0cdc97.netlify.app/).

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/140d1a64-9a45-4240-b20f-7c0a0d4a1dbc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/frolicking-mousse-0cdc97/deploys) (For now, Netlify site is deployed but one important function [the one to add a new quote] isn't working on it ðŸ¤”. Use Vercel for now)

However, if you wish to use this app locally, let's get you started correctly!

First, open up your terminal of choice, and use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/brewswain/quoted-code-challenge.git

cd quoted-code-challenge

npm install

npm run dev
```
Once you've executed all the above, open your browser, and go to `localhost:3000`

That's it!
